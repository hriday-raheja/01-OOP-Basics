# Polymorphism in C++

This folder contains Object Oriented Programming programs written in C++ that demonstrate **polymorphism**, one of the core principles of OOP. Polymorphism allows the same function or operator to behave differently based on context.

These programs are aligned with the CS305 – Object Oriented Programming & Methodology syllabus.

## 📌 Programs Included

| Concept | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Function Overloading | Demonstrates compile-time polymorphism using functions with different parameters. |
| Operator Overloading (+) | Shows how operators can be overloaded to work with user-defined data types. |
| Method Overriding | Demonstrates redefining base class methods in derived classes. |
| Runtime Polymorphism | Uses base class pointers to call derived class methods at runtime. |
| Virtual Functions | Demonstrates dynamic binding using virtual functions. |
