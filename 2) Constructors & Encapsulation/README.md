# Day-2: Constructors & Encapsulation (C++)

This folder contains Object Oriented Programming programs written in C++ that demonstrate the concepts of **constructors** and **encapsulation**. These concepts are fundamental for initializing objects and protecting class data.

The programs are aligned with the **CS305 – Object Oriented Programming & Methodology** syllabus.

## 📌 Programs Included

| Concept | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Default Constructor | Demonstrates automatic initialisation of objects using a default constructor. |
| Parameterised Constructor | Shows how objects are initialised using user-defined values. |
| Constructor Overloading | Demonstrates multiple constructors in a single class with different parameter lists. |
| Encapsulation (Private Data Members) | Shows data hiding using private data members and controlled access through public methods. |
| Deposit & Withdraw using Encapsulation | A real-world banking example demonstrating encapsulation with deposit and withdraw operations. |

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Covered

- Constructors  
- Default Constructor  
- Parameterised Constructor  
- Constructor Overloading  
- Encapsulation  
- Data Hiding  
- Object Initialisation

## 🎯 Purpose

These programs help understand how **constructors** are used to initialise objects and how **encapsulation** protects class data by restricting direct access. The examples provide a strong foundation for advanced OOP concepts such as inheritance and polymorphism.
